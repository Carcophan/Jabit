Jabit is a Java implementation for the Bitmessage protocol. If you visit this page, I assume you are a Java developer and already know about [Bitmessage][bitmessage].

Please note that it still has its limitations, but the API should now be stable. Jabit uses Semantic Versioning, meaning as long as the major version doesn't change, nothing should break if you update.

* [Quick Start]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart): take this guide, add some great ideas, and you've got your Bitmessage app.
* [Dependencies]({{ site.baseurl }}/dependencies): want to know what all those dependencies are about? Read on.
* [API]({{ site.baseurl }}/api): want to create something more complicated? An [app for Android][abit] perhaps? You probably need this in-depth documentation. [Or plough through the source right away...][jabit]
