Jabit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dissem/Jabit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dissem/Jabit)
=====

A Java implementation for the Bitmessage protocol. To build, use command `gradle build`. Note that for some tests to run, a standard Bitmessage client needs to run on the same system, using port 8444 (the default port).

Please note that development is still heavily in progress, and I will break the database a lot until it's ready for prime time.

Security
--------

If you're able to audit Jabit to verify its security, you would be very very welcome. Please be aware though that the official Bitmessage project would like an audit, too, and they were first in line.
